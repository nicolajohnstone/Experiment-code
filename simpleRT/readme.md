The Deary-Liewald reaction time task (simple stimulus-response paradigm)
Created by nicola johnstone (nicola.johnstone@surrey.ac.uk) 2021-09-07

Participants press a button (space bar) in response to the appearance of a single stimulus (X). There are eight practice trials and 20 test trials. 
Stimulus remains on screen untill response. .
ISI is randomly jittered between 1000-3000ms (in steps of 50 ms), based on screen refresh rate of 60Hz. 
Reaction time is recorded in ms. 

This experiment was created using PsychoPy3 Experiment Builder (v2021.2.3)
